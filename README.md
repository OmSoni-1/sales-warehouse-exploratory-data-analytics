# Sales Warehouse Exploratory Data Analytics

This repository contains SQL scripts for exploratory data analysis of a the sales warehouse I created as my previous project. This project is about leveraging data from `gold.dim_customers`, `gold.dim_products`, and `gold.fact_sales` tables. The analysis aims to provide insights into sales performance, customer demographics, and product trends.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on extracting valuable information from a sales warehouse using SQL queries. It covers:

* **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration of tables and columns to understand the data structure.
* **Sales Metrics:** Calculation of key sales metrics like total sales, total items sold, average price, and number of orders.
* **Customer Analysis:** Analysis of customer demographics, including country and gender distribution, as well as identification of ordering customers.
* **Product Analysis:** Examination of product categories, average costs, and revenue generated by each category.
* **Revenue Analysis:** Calculation of total revenue generated by individual customers and distribution of sold items across countries.
* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generation of a consolidated report summarizing all key metrics.

## Files

* **`sales_analysis.sql`:** Contains all SQL scripts used for the data exploration and analysis.

## Database Schema

The analysis is based on the following tables within the `gold` schema:

* **`gold.dim_customers`:** Contains customer information (customer ID, country, gender, etc.).
* **`gold.dim_products`:** Contains product information (product key, category, cost, etc.).
* **`gold.fact_sales`:** Contains sales transaction data (order number, customer key, product key, sales amount, quantity, price, etc.).

## Key Queries and Insights

The `sales_analysis.sql` script includes queries to:

* Explore the database schema and table structures.
* Calculate aggregate sales metrics.
* Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
* Analyze product performance and category trends.
* Generate a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators.
* Find the distribution of sales per country.
* Find the distribution of sales per gender.
